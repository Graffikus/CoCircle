        The circle is divided into several playing fields, depending on the number of players.
        A color that needs to be guessed appears in the center circle - the colors in each round do not appear immediately, but gradually.
        The first player, who correctly guessed the color, gets 5 points, the rest - descending.
        If the correct choice of color occurs after all the colors have fully showed, the player gets only 1 point.
        Each mistake leads to a loss of 3 points.
        Color choices can be made once per round.
        The colors are appearing for 4 seconds, one more second they are on the screen, and for one more second they fade away.
        The next round comes.
        When all the players have made a choice, the colors appear instantly.
        The more points you collect, the harder it is to choose the color, as the number of options increases.
        The goal of the game is to score 100 points first.</string>
